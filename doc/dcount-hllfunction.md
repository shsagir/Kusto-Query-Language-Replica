Calculates the dcount from hll results (which was generated by [hll](hll-aggfunction.md) or [hll_merge](hll-merge-aggfunction.md)).

Read about the [underlying algorithm (*H*yper*L*og*L*og) and estimation accuracy](dcount-aggfunction.md#estimation-accuracy).

**Syntax**

`dcount_hll(`*Expr*`)`

**Arguments**

* *Expr*: Expression which was generated by [hll](hll-aggfunction.md) or [hll-merge](hll-merge-aggfunction.md)
