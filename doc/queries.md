# Query operators

A query is a read-only operation against a Kusto Engine cluster's
ingested data. Queries always run in the context of a particular
database in the cluster (although they may also refer to data in
another database, or even in another cluster).

As ad-hoc query of data is the top-priority scenario for Kusto,
the Kusto Query Language syntax is optimized for non-expert users
authoring and running queries over their data and being able to
understand unambiguously what each query does (logically).

The language syntax is that of a data flow, where "data" really
means "tabular data" (data in one or more rows/columns rectangular
shape). At a minimum, a query consists of source data references
(references to Kusto tables) and one or more **query operators** applied
in sequence, indicated visually by the use of a pipe character (`|`)
to delimit operators.

For example:

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```kusto
StormEvents 
| where State == 'FLORIDA' and StartTime > datetime(2000-01-01)
| count
```
    
Each filter prefixed by the pipe character `|` is an instance of an *operator*,
with some parameters. The input to the operator is the table that is the result
of the preceding pipeline. In most cases, any parameters are 
[scalar expressions](./scalar-data-types/index.md) over the columns of the input.
In a few cases, the parameters are the names of input columns, and in a few cases,
the parameter is a second table. The result of a query is always a table,
even if it only has one column and one row.

## Reference: Query operators

> `T` is used in query examples below to denote the preceding pipeline or source table.
