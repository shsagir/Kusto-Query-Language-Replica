# series_periods_detect()

Finds the most significant periods that exist in a time series.  

Very often a metric measuring an applicationâ€™s traffic is characterized by two significant periods: a weekly and a daily. Given such a time series, `series_periods_detect()` shall detect these 2 dominant periods.  
The function takes as input a column containing a dynamic array of time series (typically the resulting output of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) operator), two `real` numbers defining the minimal and maximal period size (i.e. number of bins, e.g. for 1h bin the size of a daily period would be 24) to search for, and a `long` number defining the total number of periods for the function to search. The function outputs 2 columns:
* *periods*: a dynamic array containing the periods that have been found (in units of the bin size), ordered by their scores
* *scores*: a dynamic array containing values between 0 and 1, each measures the significance of a period in its respective position in the *periods* array
 
**Syntax**

`series_periods_detect(`*x*`,` *min_period*`,` *max_period*`,` *num_periods*`)`

**Arguments**

* *x*: Dynamic array scalar expression which is an array of numeric values, typically the resulting output of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) or [make_list](makelist-aggfunction.md) operators.
* *min_period*: A `real` number specifying the minimal period to search for.
* *max_period*: A `real` number specifying the maximal period to search for.
* *num_periods*: A `long` number specifying the maximum required number of periods. This will be the length of the output dynamic arrays.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The algorithm can detect periods containing at least 4 points and at most half of the series length. 
>
> * You should set the *min_period* a little below and *max_period* a little above the periods you expect to find in the time series. For example, if you have an hourly-aggregated signal, and you look for both daily > and weekly periods (that would be 24 & 168 respectively) you can set *min_period*=0.8\*24, *max_period*=1.2\*168, leaving 20% margins around these periods.
>
> * The input time series must be regular, i.e. aggregated in constant bins (which is always the case if it has been created using [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md)). Otherwise, the output is meaningless.


**Example**

The following query embeds a snapshot of a month of an applicationâ€™s traffic, aggregated twice a day (i.e. the bin size is 12 hours).

Running `series_periods_detect()` on this series results in the weekly period (14 points long):

Note that the daily period that can be also seen in the chart was not found since the sampling is too coarse (12h bin size) so a daily period of 2 bins is bellow the minimum period size of 4 points required by the algorithm.
