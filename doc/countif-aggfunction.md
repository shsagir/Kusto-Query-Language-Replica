# countif() (aggregation function)

Returns a count of rows for which *Predicate* evaluates to `true`.

* Can be used only in context of aggregation inside [summarize](summarizeoperator.md)

See also - [count()](count-aggfunction.md) function, which counts rows without predicate expression.

**Syntax**

summarize `countif(`*Predicate*`)`

**Arguments**

* *Predicate*: Expression that will be used for aggregation calculation. 

**Returns**

Returns a count of rows for which *Predicate* evaluates to `true`.

> [!TIP]
> Use `summarize countif(filter)` instead of `where filter | summarize count()`
