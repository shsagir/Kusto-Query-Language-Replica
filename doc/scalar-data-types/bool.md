# The bool data type

The `bool` (`boolean`) data type can have one of two states: `true` or `false`
(internally encoded as `1` and `0`, respectively), as well as the null value.

## bool literals

The `bool` data type has the following literals:
* `true` and `bool(true)`: Representing trueness
* `false` and `bool(false)`:  Representing falsehood
* `bool(null)`: See [null values](null-values.md)

## bool operators

The `bool` data type supports the following operators:
equality (`==`), inequality (`!=`), logical-and (`and`), and logical-or (`or`).
