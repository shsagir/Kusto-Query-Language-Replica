# series_periods_validate()

Checks whether a time series contains periodic patterns of given lengths.  

Very often a metric measuring the traffic of an application is characterized by a weekly and/or daily periods. This can be confirmed by running `series_periods_validate()` checking for a weekly and daily periods.

The function takes as input a column containing a dynamic array of time series (typically the resulting output of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) operator), and one or more `real` numbers that define the lengths of the periods to validate. 

The function outputs 2 columns:
* *periods*: a dynamic array containing the periods to validate (supplied in the input)
* *scores*: a dynamic array containing a score between 0 and 1 that measures the significance of a period in its respective position in the *periods* array

**Syntax**

`series_periods_validate(`*x*`,` *period1* [ `,` *period2* `,` . . . ] `)`

**Arguments**

* *x*: Dynamic array scalar expression which is an array of numeric values, typically the resulting output of [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md) or [make_list](makelist-aggfunction.md) operators.
* *period1*, *period2*, etc.: `real` numbers specifying the periods to validate, in units of the bin size. For example, if the series is in 1h bins, a weekly period is 168 bins.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * The minimal value for each of the *period* arguments is **4** and the maximal is half of the length of the input series; for a *period* argument outside these bounds, the output score will be **0**.
>
> * The input time series must be regular, i.e. aggregated in constant bins (which is always the case if it has been created using [make-series](make-seriesoperator.md)). Otherwise, the output is meaningless.
> 
> * The function accepts up to 16 periods to validate.


**Example**

The following query embeds a snapshot of a month of an applicationâ€™s traffic, aggregated twice a day (i.e. the bin size is 12 hours).

Running `series_periods_validate()` on this series to validate a weekly period (14 points long) results in a high score,  and with a **0** score  when validating a five days period (10 points long).
