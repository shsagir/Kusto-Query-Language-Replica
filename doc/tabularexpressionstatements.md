# Tabular expression statements

The tabular expression statement is what people usually have in mind when they
talk about queries. This statement usually appears last in the statement list,
and both its input and its output consists of tables or tabular data sets.

Kusto uses a data flow model for the tabular expression statement. The typical
structure of a tabular expression statement is a composition of *tabular data sources*
(such as Kusto tables), *tabular data operators* (such as filters
and projections), and potentially *rendering operators*. The composition is
represented by the pipe character (`|`), giving the statement a very regular
form that visually represents the flow of tabular data from left to right.
Each operator accepts a tabular data set "from the pipe", and additional inputs
(including other tabular data sets) from the body of the operator, then emits
a tabular data set to the next operator that follows:   

*source1* `|` *operator1* `|` *operator2* `|` *renderInstruction*

In the following example, the source is `Logs` (a reference to a table in the
current database), the first operator is `where` (which filter out records
from its input according to some per-record predicate), and the second operator
is `count` (which counts the number of records in its input data set):

<!-- csl -->
```
Logs | where Timestamp > ago(1d) | count
```

In the following more complex example, the `join` operator is used to combine
records from two input data sets: one which is a filter on the `Logs` table,
and another which is a filter on the `Events` table.

<!-- csl -->
```
Logs 
| where Timestamp > ago(1d) 
| join 
(
    Events 
    | where continent == 'Europe'
) on RequestId 
```

## Tabular data sources

A **tabular data source** produces sets of records, to be further processed
by **tabular data operators**. Kusto supports a number of these sources:

* Table references (which refer to a Kusto table, in the context database
  or some other cluster/database.)
* The tabular [range operator](rangeoperator.md).
* The [print operator](printoperator.md).
* An invocation of a function that returns a table.
* A [table literal](datatableoperator.md) ("datatable").
