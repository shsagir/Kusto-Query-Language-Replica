# Regular expressions

RE2 regular expression syntax describes the syntax of the regular expression library used by Kusto (re2).
There are a few functions in Kusto that perform string matching, selection, and extraction by using a regular expression

- [countof()](countoffunction.md)
- [extract()](extractfunction.md)
- [extract_all()](extractallfunction.md)
- [matches regex](datatypes-string-operators.md)
- [parse operator](parseoperator.md)
- [replace()](replacefunction.md)
- [trim()](trimfunction.md)
- [trimend()](trimendfunction.md)
- [trimstart()](trimstartfunction.md)

The regular expression syntax supported by Kusto is that of the
[re2 library](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax). These expressions must be encoded in Kusto as `string` literals, and all of Kusto's string quoting rules apply. For example, the regular expression `\A` matches the beginning of a line, and is specified in Kusto as the string literal `"\\A"` (note the "extra" backslash (`\`) character.)
