# Joining within time window

It is often useful to join between two large data sets on some high-cardinality key
(such as an operation ID or a session ID) and further limit the right-hand-side (`$right`)
records that need to be matched for each left-hand-side (`$left`) record by adding
a restriction on the "time-distance" between `datetime` columns on the left and on the
right. This differs from
usual Kusto join operation as, in addition to the "equi-join" part (matching the high-cardinality
key or the left and right data sets), the system can also apply a distance function
and use it to speed-up the join considerably. Note that a distance function does not
behave like equality (that is, when both `dist(x,y)` and `dist(y,z)` are true it does
not follow that `dist(x,z)` is also true.)
*Internally, we sometimes refer to this as "diagonal join".*

For example, assume that we want to identify event sequences within a relatively small
time window. To demonstrate this example, assume we have a table `T` with the following
schema:

- `SessionId`: A column of type `string` with correlation IDs.
- `EventType`: A column of type `string` that identifies the event type of the record.
- `Timestamp`: A column of type `datetime` indicating when the event described
  by the record happened.

let T = datatable(SessionId:string, EventType:string, Timestamp:datetime)
[
    '0', 'A', datetime(2017-10-01 00:00:00),
    '0', 'B', datetime(2017-10-01 00:01:00),
    '1', 'B', datetime(2017-10-01 00:02:00),
    '1', 'A', datetime(2017-10-01 00:03:00),
    '3', 'A', datetime(2017-10-01 00:04:00),
    '3', 'B', datetime(2017-10-01 00:10:00),
];
T

|SessionId|EventType|Timestamp|
|---|---|---|
|0|A|2017-10-01 00:00:00.0000000|
|0|B|2017-10-01 00:01:00.0000000|
|1|B|2017-10-01 00:02:00.0000000|
|1|A|2017-10-01 00:03:00.0000000|
|3|A|2017-10-01 00:04:00.0000000|

**Problem statement**

We want our query to answer the following question:

   Find all the session IDs in which event type `A` was followed by an
   event type `B` within `1min` time window.

(In the sample data above, the only such session ID is `0`.)

Semantically, the following query answers this question, albeit inefficiently:

<!-- csl -->
```
T 
| where EventType == 'A'
| project SessionId, Start=Timestamp
| join kind=inner
    (
    T 
    | where EventType == 'B'
    | project SessionId, End=Timestamp
    ) on SessionId
| where (End - Start) between (0min .. 1min)
| project SessionId, Start, End 

```

|SessionId|Start|End|
|---|---|---|
|0|2017-10-01 00:00:00.0000000|2017-10-01 00:01:00.0000000|

To optimize this query, we can rewrite it as described below
so that the time window is expressed as a join key.

**Rewriting the query to account for the time window**

The idea is to rewrite the query so that the `datetime` values are
"discretized" into buckets whose size is half the size of the time window.
We can then use Kusto's equi-join to compare those bucket IDs.

<!-- csl -->
```
let lookupWindow = 1min;
let lookupBin = lookupWindow / 2.0; // lookup bin = equal to 1/2 of the lookup window
T 
| where EventType == 'A'
| project SessionId, Start=Timestamp,
          // TimeKey on the left side of the join is mapped to a discrete time axis for the join purpose
          TimeKey = bin(Timestamp, lookupBin)
| join kind=inner
    (
    T 
    | where EventType == 'B'
    | project SessionId, End=Timestamp,
              // TimeKey on the right side of the join - emulates event 'B' appearing several times
              // as if it was 'replicated'
              TimeKey = range(bin(Timestamp-lookupWindow, lookupBin),
                              bin(Timestamp, lookupBin),
                              lookupBin)
    // 'mv-expand' translates the TimeKey array range into a column
    | mv-expand TimeKey to typeof(datetime)
    ) on SessionId, TimeKey 
| where (End - Start) between (0min .. lookupWindow)
| project SessionId, Start, End 
```

|SessionId|Start|End|
|---|---|---|
|0|2017-10-01 00:00:00.0000000|2017-10-01 00:01:00.0000000|


**Runnable query reference (with table inlined)**

let lookupWindow = 1min;
let lookupBin = lookupWindow / 2.0;

**50M data query**

The next query emulates data set of 50M records and ~10M IDs and runs the query with the technique described above.

<!-- csl: https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples -->
```
let T = range x from 1 to 50000000 step 1
| extend SessionId = rand(10000000), EventType = rand(3), Time=datetime(2017-01-01)+(x * 10ms)
| extend EventType = case(EventType <= 1, "A",
                          EventType <= 2, "B",
                          "C");
let lookupWindow = 1min;
let lookupBin = lookupWindow / 2.0;
T 
| where EventType == 'A'
| project SessionId, Start=Time, TimeKey = bin(Time, lookupBin)
| join kind=inner
    (
    T 
    | where EventType == 'B'
    | project SessionId, End=Time, 
              TimeKey = range(bin(Time-lookupWindow, lookupBin), 
                              bin(Time, lookupBin),
                              lookupBin)
    | mv-expand TimeKey to typeof(datetime)
    ) on SessionId, TimeKey 
| where (End - Start) between (0min .. lookupWindow)
| project SessionId, Start, End 
| count 
```
